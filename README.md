For larger amount of artworks, horisontal scrollbar is appeared, but scrolling via mouse wheel is supported too(note: page scroll is disabled while this, move mouse out of preview to reenable it). Preview gallery is located 40px from horizontal page edges(considering small screens and window resizing).
